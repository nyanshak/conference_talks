Abstract:

Osquery can be a powerful tool to improve your security posture, but how do you
transform that potential into a full-scale deployment to all of your systems?

In this talk, Brendan Shaklovitz shares his journey of deploying osquery at
scale, from a proof-of-concept into a managed network of more than 30,000
macOS, Linux, and Windows systems. He looks at how values shaped his company's
osquery deployment, and what the organization would do differently if they were
starting today.

Brendan identifies and provides the ingredients needed to manage osquery at
scale, from documentation to configuration management to tracking osquery
system coverage. For added spice, he also shares his wishlist for improving
osquery deployment.
